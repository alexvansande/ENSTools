// This is a quick and small library for allowing any contract to
// use ENS names like they would use a standard address.
// So a DAO can have bob.eth as the member, instead of 0x123,
// and therefore Bob can change that address to whatever they prefer
// or give out a tip that can be only received by the rightful owner of example.com
// even if example.com owner never heard about ethereum!
//
// To use it, just use a store the NameHash as a string and then call
// updateAddress(NameHash) to save the latest ethereum address it points to
// Once that has been saved, use ensAddresses(NameHash) to obtain a valid eth address.
// Optionally, you can check lastUpdatedENSAt(NameHash) to check the last time
// it was updated. If it was never updated then both functions should return 0:
// IMPORTANT: check if address is not address(0) before sending ether.
