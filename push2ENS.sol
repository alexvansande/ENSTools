// A little contract that adds push & pull money transfer to ENS ensAddresses.
// Will work with any ENS, existing or future, including DNS names!
// Ether, tokens and NFTs remain locked by contract until ENS is set up properly.
// Once ENS points to a non-zero address, anyone can pull it there.
//
// Want to donate USDC to wikipedia.org but they don't have an eth address yet?
// Want to send an NFT to xkcd.org but you're not sure how to trust the address?
// Want to make an Ether bounty for the Ethiopian government to be aware of ENS?
// Now you can do all that and more!
// But wait, there's more! You can also use it to push to a normal address.
// Just because.
//
// ATTENTION: use at your own risk! I've barely tested it. And by barely I mean I tried a couple different things
// on rinkeby and once they worked I deployed to mainnet. NFTs don't use _safeTransfer
// because I was too lazy to build my own onerc721Received. Be careful out there.
